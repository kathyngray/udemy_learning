<h3>1. Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban</h3>
<p>
    I love this movie so much because it's the first time Harry saw true hope when he found out that he has a godfather.

<h3>2. Arcane</h3>
<p>
    This is a very good anime my husband introduced to me. Great story line with amazing artwork. The entire anime is
    painted.

<h3>3. Psych</h3>

    I can watch this sitcom over and over again. I HAVE! It's a great funny detective show.
